# WOC-ML-BOOTCAMP
The repository contains codes of basic ML Algorithms like Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, Logistic Regression, KNN and Neural Networks. 
Codes are added as separate google collab notebooks.
Predictions of each algorithm have been saved in CSV files.
The repository also contains a Report for the project highlighting how the hyperparameters were chosen and what was used during coding process.
It will also contain test data CSV files for all algorithms.
